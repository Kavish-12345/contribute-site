# Introduction

This glossary covers CNCF-specific terms, including CNCF group acronyms or how projects are organized within our ecosystem (for technical definitions, please refer to the [Cloud Native Glossary](https://glossary.cncf.io/). As with everything else on [contribute.cncf.io](https://contribute.cncf.io/), this is a living document, and we encourage anyone seeing gaps to raise an issue or submit a PR.
